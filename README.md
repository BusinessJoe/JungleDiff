# JungleDiff

An open source webapp created by Lukas Boelling, Max Ning, Richard Duan, and Jordan Jamali. We are currently waiting on a license from Riot Games so that we may legally and publicly host the website. 

JungleDiff was created so that League of Legends players are able to see detailed and insightful analysis on their jungle gameplay, through an easy-to-use and intuitive webapp.
